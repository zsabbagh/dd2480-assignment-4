## Project

Name: Loguru

URL: https://github.com/Delgan/loguru

A logger library for Python3.

## Onboarding experience

We chose a new project, since our previous library was a loosly coupled
algorithms and data structure collection.

**If you changed the project, how did your experience differ from before?**
This project is more difficult and not as modular as our previous project.
It is fairly small in comparison to other open source projects, with 12LOC.
One advantage of the project was the fact that it is not rapidly updated/have high engagement, which lessens the risk of someone else working on our issue.
The documentation is fairly clear.
